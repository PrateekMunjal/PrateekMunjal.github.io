title: Underlying base model of my posts
---

In this post, I will be explaining the base model I follow while writing the posts. I always liked the idea of [five W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws) to explain a concept. I choose this five W's as a base model for my posts because it gives a abstract summary of a concept in just 5 points. Moreover, on many blogs I could not find a abstract infograph demonstrating the metadata of new machine learning model/technique. Thus, I will be utilizing this five W's idea for making a infograph along with detailed analysis of machine learning papers.

## Infograph Model

Albeit the 5 W's are already defined, I made subtle changes as per our research posts need. Thus the proposed post model will include the following points:

1. Who, When and Where -- describes authors and the conference name at which it is accepted
2. What -- [New model/ New strategy/ Theoretical Analysis]
3. Why -- This will generally include the motivation of the paper. 
4. Area -- It demonstrates the domain/area under which research paper solves the problem.
5. How -- This will be a github link to the code because that literally means "how" :)

## A sample infograph is as follows:

	</figure>
</center>

## Post Template
Further, I define a template for each of my posts. The template will have the following in order:

* Problem Statement
* Motivation
* Analogy, If I am able to construct one! :) 
* Proposed Approach
* Theoretical bounds (if any)
* Results
* Conlusion
