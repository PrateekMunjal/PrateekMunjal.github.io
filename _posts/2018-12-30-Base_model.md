title: Underlying base model of my posts
---

I will be explaining the base model of generating the posts, i.e, the idea of leveraging the commonly known [five W's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws). I choose this base model for the posts because on many blogs I could not find a abstract infograph demonstrating the metadata. 

## Infograph Model

Albeit the 5 W's are already defined, I made subtle changes as per our research posts need. Thus the proposed post model contains following:

1. Who, When and Where -- describes authors and the conference name at which it is accepted
2. What -- [New model/ New strategy/ Theoretical Analysis]
3. Why -- This will generally include the motivation of the paper. 
4. Area -- It demonstrates the domain/area under which research paper solves the problem.
5. How -- This will be a github link to the code because that literally means "how" :)

## Post Template
Further, I define a template for each of my posts. The template will have the following in order:

* Problem Statement
* Motivation
* Analogy (If I am able to construct one!:simple_smile:)
* Proposed Approach
* Theoretical bounds (if any)
* Results
* Conlusion
