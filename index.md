My name is Prateek Munjal. I am currently pursuing masters in computer science & engineering at IIT Ropar. I will be graduating in this year 2019. I am working in the area of machine learning, precisely in deep generative modelling. I usually spend the day by learning the complex maths behind the deep magic and implementing some of SOTA models.

This is my blog where I will be writing my insights and experiences when implementing various SOTA models. You can find my posts [here]({{site.baseurl}}blog).
